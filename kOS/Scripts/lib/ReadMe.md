## Naming Protocols for libary files.

*the files should be divided into the following types:*

(lb_)	library consisists of multiple books
(bk_)	book consists of several chapters
(ch_)	chapter consists of several pages
(pg_)	pages consist of several paragraphs
(pa_)	paragraphs consists of several sentences, usually related.
(sn_)	sentence consist of several woods, usually related.
(wd_)	smallest unit. one function.

words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, chapters are all used to make up book that make up the library.

mission: to provide a structure to create new library files from existing scraps.

eventually words will be archived into a seperate sub folder and not needed.
same goes for sentences, paragraphs, pages, and chapters. all that will remain in the library are mostly books.
